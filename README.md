This project implements a web application using the Spring Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. It clearly separates the application logic into three distinct layers: the Controller (handling requests), the Model (holding data), and the View (rendering the output). It demonstrates how Spring's DispatcherServlet maps incoming requests to appropriate handler methods, enabling efficient, decoupled, and testable web development.
